# ThinkFleet Enterprise License

The ThinkFleet Enterprise License (the "Enterprise License") grants additional
rights beyond those provided by the Sustainable Use License. Files containing
".ee." in the filename or located in a directory containing ".ee" in its name
require a valid Enterprise License to use in production.

## What Requires an Enterprise License

- Source files matching the pattern `*.ee.*` (e.g., `feature.ee.ts`)
- Directories matching the pattern `*.ee*` (e.g., `src/features.ee/`)
- Any functionality explicitly documented as requiring an Enterprise License

## Without an Enterprise License

You may view and study the Enterprise-licensed source code. You may not use,
copy, modify, or distribute Enterprise-licensed files in production without a
valid Enterprise License agreement.
